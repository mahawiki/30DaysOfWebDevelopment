      <h1 id="tag">  Description/Taste</h1>
      <p>
Jamun are berries with an oblong shape similar to Kalamata olives. They have a dark purple to almost black skin with a starkly contrasting pink or white flesh. The flesh is extremely juicy and has a flavor that combines sweet and tart with a slightly astringent aftertaste. The fruit contains a hard seed which should be discarded. When eaten, the dark-colored skin leaves a stain on the lips and mouth that can last for several hours.</p>

<h1> Seasons/Availability</h1>
<p>
Jamun fruit is produced almost year-round in tropical and sub-tropical climates with a peak season in the summer.</p>

<h1>Current Facts</h1> 
<p>
Jamun fruit is botanically known as Syzygium cumini and is produced on an evergreen tree that reaches up to 20 feet tall. In its native India, the fruit is also called Jambul or Jaam. Around the world the small fruit is known as Java plum, Black plum, Lomboy, Duhat, and Indian blackberry. The Jamun tree is revered by Buddhists; in Indian mythology, Lord Rama subsisted on Jamun fruit during his 14-day exile in the forest. This lore earned the fruit the nickname “fruit of the Gods.” The Jamun tree lives for over 100 years.</p>

<h1>Nutritional Value</h1>

In Ayurvedic medicine, the berries and other parts of the Jamun tree are used to treat anemia, digestive issues, respiratory infections and is also used to regulate one’s heartbeat.
