        It is best to pick oranges at the peak of their ripeness. Unlike some other fruits, they do not ripen or improve in quality after picking. People should store oranges at room temperature and away from direct sunlight.</p>
        <p>
        
        It can be hard to find ripe fruits and vegetables in the winter. However, this is the perfect time to buy citrus fruits. Winter is the peak season for oranges and other citruses.</p>
